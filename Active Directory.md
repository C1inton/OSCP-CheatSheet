# Active Directory

Active Directory follows a clear hierarchy, from top to bottom. In that hierarchy are: forests, trees, and domains.

**Forests:** represent the complete Active Directory instance, and are logical containers made up of domain trees, domains, and organizational units.

**Trees:** are collections of domains within the same DNS namespace; these include child domains.


**Domains:** are logical groupings of network objects such as computers, users, applications, and devices on the network such as printers.
